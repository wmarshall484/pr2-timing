This package contains a library for timing motion primitives that the
pr2 arm could perform. It accomplishes this by recording in
programmer-specified intervals how long it takes each joint of the pr2
to move a certain distance. For a given primitive, it is assumed that
all of the joints move simultaneously; therefore, the joint that takes
the longest to move represents the running time of that motion
primitive.

There are two issues with this method: Firstly, we are assuming that
each joint is starting and stopping at rest, which may not be the
case. Because of this, the function tends to overestimate time values. In the future it would be better to take advantage of the
timePath() function in the trajectory_recorder/arm.cpp file and record
times for motion primitives that are in motion. In order to do that,
some experimentation must be done to find the proper time values to
assign the points in a trajectory that would be tested.

Secondly, this method discretises the distances that a joint can move,
and approximates the time that an arbitrary distance would take by
interpolating between the nearest two recorded distances.
